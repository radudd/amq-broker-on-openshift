#Â This services are of type: ClusterIP - accessible only inside the cluster
# since we are using SSL, the brokers are exposed using SSL routes, so services don't need to be externally reachable
# the services should be created manually as the Operator creates services that matches a single broker. These Services match both brokers and load balance through them
